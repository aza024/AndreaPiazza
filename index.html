        <h1>Hello! I'm Andréa Piazza!</h1>
        <p class="aboutAP">
            an enthusiastic full-stack web developer!  My goal is to create meaningful web applications that are enjoyable to use through writing thoughtful code that focuses on user-centered design. I’m addicted to learning and especially love web development because my interest of development and design converge. Let’s connect and talk about how I can bring my passion my to your project! 
        </p>
        <p class = "aboutP">
            Since graduating from The State University of New York’s Polytechnic Institute in 2015, I worked as an application engineer for two years. Although I loved my time working for Steelcase Inc., I didn’t have an outlet for my creativity my work and decided to moved across the country and take General Assembly’s Web Development Immersive course.
        </p>  
        <p class ="aboutP">  
            When I’m not coding, I can be found reading or wandering around San Francisco trying to find the best french fries in the city. I’m happiest when I’m around family, friends, or someone I can learn from. I enjoy staying active through LIT classes, yoga, walking, or doing Krav Maga. I used to dress my cat up every Halloween, until the cat decided to live with my father in New York because he feeds her hot dogs and ice cream. Now, I stay happy dressing up webpages.
