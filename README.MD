Technologies - 

For the portfolio project, I utilized 
HTML - for create structure of website, 
CSS - to style website, 
    Media Queries - to make wesbite responsive
Javascript - to make website interactive, 
JQuery - make website interactive, 
Bootstrap - for carousel and nav bar,
Font Awesome - icons, 
Google Fonts -custom fonts, 
Google API -for Google maps. 

Process/Approach - 

My process initiated with wireframing that allowed me to create a guideline of how the website will be laid out. From there, I began wrting the HTML/CSS and spent too much time trying to focus on the design of the page which I ultimately changed. After the page was designed, I began making it functional which I now realize should have been my priorty. Finally, I began adding media queries. 

Unsolved problems - 

I had trouble with media queries and formatting the carousel. I also had some layout issues, specifically with the hamburger and resizing navigation. 

Wins & Challenges - 

My greatest success in this project was getting the lightbox to work using my own Javascript, however it can be improved by adding loops and better formatting in the future.

My most significant opportunity for improvement is my process. I spent too much time trying to format objects that were ultimately moved or disregarded and not enough time working on the basic structure. From now on, I plan on making my website functional before applying design. I learned that I need to review positioning and responsive design. 

I also have the opportunity to make my code dry. I had difficulty with SASS compiling into my CSS file and was making changes that ultimately didn't do anything. Also, Bootstrap template styles over-wrote styles that I was working with, and I need to be more cognizant of the default themes and their hidden properties.
